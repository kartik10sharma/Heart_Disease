# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web App

A Flask-based machine learning web application that predicts the presence of heart disease based on various clinical health metrics such as cholesterol, CRP, blood pressure, and more.

---

## 📊 Dataset & Model

- **Dataset Source**: Not explicitly mentioned (assumed to be a heart health dataset containing patient clinical information).
- **Model Used**: Trained and saved as `heart_model.pkl` using a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- **Target Output**: Binary classification — `Heart Disease Detected` or `No Heart Disease`.

## ⚙️ Input Features

The application uses the following patient health metrics as inputs:

| Feature              | Description                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cholesterol Level     | Numeric value (e.g., mg/dL)            |
| Smoking              | Yes/No                                 |
| Diabetes             | Yes/No                                 |
| Age                  | Numeric (years)                        |
| High Blood Pressure  | Yes/No                                 |
| Triglyceride Level   | Numeric value                          |
| CRP Level            | C-Reactive Protein level (mg/L)        |

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can install manually:

```bash
pip install Flask pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
```

### 3. Ensure Model File Exists

Make sure `heart_model.pkl` is in the project directory.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
